// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
Divide your number by 2. (Do not use zero as your number!)

If there a remainder?
* If Yes, your number is odd.
* If No, your number is even.


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo-code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)


(A) Read in 5 separate numbers.
Get 5 separate numbers
n is 1
Times will hold the numbers

Ask for a number while n is 5 or less
	"What's your number? __"
	Save the number to Times(n)
	Add 1 to n
	

(B) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
Sum your five numbers then divide by 5

n is 1
TotalTime is 0
Do this while n is 5 or less
	TotalTime = TotalTime + Time(n)
        Add 1 to n

TotalTime divided by 2 equals AverageNumber

(C) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
Get the minimum
----------------
n is 1
nMinimum equals Number(1) (the first number from the series above)

Do this while n is 5 or less
	Is Number(n) less than nMinimum?
		If Yes, nMinimum = Number(n)
	Add 1 to n

The smallest number is nMinimum!


Get the maximum
---------------
n is 1
nMaximum is 0

Do this while n is 5 or less
	Is Number(n) greater than nMaximum?
		If Yes, nMaximum = Number(n)
	Add 1 to n

The largest number is nMaximum!

(D)
StepB is the average of the 5 numbers by summing them together, then dividing by their count of numbers.

StepC compared each number to all the others.  For minimum, where a number was less than the comparison, it was saved as the "minimum."  For maximum, where a number was greater than the comparison, it was saved as the "maximum."
