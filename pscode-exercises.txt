// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
Divide your number by 2.

If there a remainder?
* If Yes, your number is odd.
* If No, your number is even.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

(A) Read in 5 separate numbers.
Get 5 separate numbers
Time is 1
Ask for a number if Time is 5 or less
	What's your number? __
	Save the number to Time
	If Time is 5 or less, ask again

(B) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
Sum your five numbers then divide by 5
Time1 + Time2 + Time3 + Time4 + Time5 = TotalTime
TotalTime divided by 2 equals AverageOfFiveTimes

(C) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
Get the minimum
n = 1
nMinimum = Number(1)

Do this while n is 5 or less
	Is Number(n) less than minimum?
		If Yes, nMinimum = Number(n)
	add 1 to n

The smallest number is nMinimum!

(D)
StepB is the average of the 5 numbers that were entered.
StepC compared each number to the others to determine which was the smallest, and then again for which was the largest.
